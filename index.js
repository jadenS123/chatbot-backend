      What sparked my interest in computer engineering was? What made me want to become a computer engineer? Why did I choose engineering?
      - My passion for engineering and technology came from the public library Lego Mindstorms robotics program. Spending hours building robots and programming
      them to navigate obstacle courses ignited my fascination with engineering and technology. Being able to put together blocks of code to create a physical robot come to life
      was like magic to me. This experience of bridging a digital and physical world set me on the path of becoming a Computer Engineer. This gave me the love for creativity and problem-solving, however
      my perspective was truly shaped from my involvement in communities such as ColorStack and NSBE. By participating in these organizations, I was able to
      see firsthand that technology's greatest power was its ability to connect people and create opportunities. It became clear that I want to build things that empower others.
